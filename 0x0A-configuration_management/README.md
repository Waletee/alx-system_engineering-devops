### 0x0A-configuration_management

In this project, I started working with Puppet as a configuration management
tool. I practiced writing Puppet manifest files to create a file, install a
package, and execute a command.

## Tasks :

* **0. Create a file**
  * [0-create_a_file.pp](./0-create_a_file.pp): Using Puppet, create a file in /tmp.

  Requirements:

    * File path is /tmp/school
    * File permission is 0744
    * File owner is www-data
    * File group is www-data
    * File contains I love Puppet

* **1. Install a package**
  * [1-install_a_package.pp](./1-install_a_package.pp):Using Puppet, install flask from pip3.

  Requirements:

    * Install flask
    * Version must be 2.1.0.

* **2. Execute a command**
  * [2-execute_a_command.pp](./2-execute_a_command.pp): Using Puppet, create a manifest that kills a process named `killmenow`.

  Requirements:

    * Must use the exec Puppet resource
    * Must use pkill
  Example:

  Terminal #0 - starting my process.
